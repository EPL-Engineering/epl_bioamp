You have digital calipers that read beyond a thousandth of an inch? You are making me feel like a dinosaur — the digital ones that I have seen in the Lab are only good to 0.001”. The vernier ones reading to 0.001” are quite sufficient for most of what we do.

I had sent you measurements back in June:

1.016” overall length
0.298” plastic sleeve diameter max at junction
0.296 plastic sleeve diameter at top
0.545” plastic sleeve length
0.470” 2mm pin exposed length
0.078” 2mm pin diameter — about 2.06mm

Going in tomorrow, let me know if you need more information. The only spare ones I know are dedicated for Sharon’s chamber.
